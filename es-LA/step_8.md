## Challenge: add more colours to the palette

Can you add more colours to the palette?

+ Choose the colours you want to use in your pixel art, and add them to your code. Then create some cool pixel images.

Hint: The bright green colour is called `chartreuse`. Here is a [list of colour names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp) from which you can pick your favourites.

You can use the Snipping Tool in Windows (or an alternative if you're not using Windows) to save a copy of your pixel art as an image file.
