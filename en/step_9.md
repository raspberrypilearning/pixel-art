## Challenge: add more colours to the palette

Can you add more colours to the **palette**?

Add them to your code. Then create some colourful pixel images!

Here is an example:

**Tip**: The bright green colour is called `chartreuse`. Here is a [list of colour names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp){:target="_blank} from which you can pick your favourites.

**Test:** Run your code and create a piece of pixel art!


You can use the Snipping Tool in Windows (or an alternative if you're not using Windows) to save a copy of your pixel art as an image file and share it with your friends and family.
